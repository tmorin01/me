									   Scroll down for more info about me. Use the navigation bar <br \>
									   above to learn about the cool science projects I get to work on.</p>

								<h2>Professional Bio</h2>
								<p> I am currently a second-year PhD student at Boston University in the Graduate Program for
								    Neuroscience. I work in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab where we use brain imaging technologies
								    like fMRI and EEG to study memory and spatial navigation in humans. My primary mentor is Dr. Chantal Stern.
								    In 2017 I graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Cognitive &amp; 
								    Brain Science and Computer Science. As an undergraduate, I spent two years working with
								    PET and MRI neuroimaging technologies at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at
								    Mass General Hospital. I am interested in machine learning and funcitonal neuroimaging,
								    and hope that my research will contribute to a better understanding of memory, attention,
								    and other aspects of basic cognition. I am originally from Braintree, MA and have lived
								    in the Boston area my entire life. Outside of lab, I enjoy running and kayaking on the
								    Charles River. On this website, I've included some highlights from past projects that I've
								    worked on. I have plans to upload my old personal statements, fellowship proposals, and to
								    make my code/data public when possible. I hope this site can serve as a resource for other
								    scientists, and those interested in becomming scientists.
