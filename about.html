									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me_in_lab.png" alt="Me sitting in front of a computer in the lab I used to work at with some brain images opened up" /></div>
								<p> I grew up in a town called Braintree and have lived in the Boston area my entire life. 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree,_Massachusetts">Braintree</a> is a weird name
									for a town, and when I was a kid I imagined that somewhere there must be a tree with brains growing out of it.
									I couldn't wait to find this tree, pick my very own brain from among the branches, and see what it looked like.
									I was wrong about the tree, but now I get to look at brains all the time! I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the MGH Martinos Center and a Visiting Scientist at Brandeis University. My research studies how age and neurochemistry affect the network stucture of the brain. My primary mentors are Dr. Anne Berry and Dr. Jacob Hooker. </p>
									<p> Previously, I completed my PhD at Boston 
									University in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/neuro/academics/graduate/">Graduate Program for Neuroscience</a>. At BU, I worked in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab where we use brain imaging technologies like fMRI to study abstract reasoning in humans. My primary mentor was <a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/chantal-stern-dphil/">Dr. Chantal Stern</a>.</p>
								<p> In 2017 I graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/undergraduate/concCognitive.htm">Cognitive &amp; 
								    Brain Science</a> and <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a>. As an undergraduate, I spent two years working with
								    PET and MRI neuroimaging technologies at the <a href="">Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</a> at
								    Mass General Hospital. I am interested in machine learning and funcitonal neuroimaging,
								    and hope that my research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic cognitive
								    building blocks that support the human mind.</p>
								<p> Outside of lab, I enjoy running and kayaking on the
								    Charles River. On this website, I've included some highlights from my scientific research,
								    as well as some side projects like trying to use machine learning to <a href="./rpdr_predictions.html">predict the winner
								    of RuPaul's Drag Race</a>, and learning how to <a href="./3dbrain.html">3D-print my own brain</a>! I hope this site can serve as a 
								    resource for other scientists, and those interested in becomming scientists.
